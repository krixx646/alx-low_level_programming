README file for C - Bit manipulation project:

This project involves performing bit manipulation operations on data using C programming language. Bit manipulation is a technique used to manipulate the individual bits of a data item, usually an integer or a character, to perform various operations such as setting, clearing, toggling, or testing individual bits.

The main focus of this project is to demonstrate the use of bitwise operators such as AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>). These operators are used to manipulate individual bits of a data item.

The project provides various examples of how to perform bit manipulation operations on different data types such as integers and characters. It also demonstrates how to convert between binary and hexadecimal representations of data.

To run the project, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. You can compile and run the code using a command-line interface or an integrated development environment (IDE).

The project includes the source code and a README file, which provides instructions on how to compile and run the code. The code is well-commented and easy to understand, making it accessible even for beginners.

Overall, this project is a useful resource for anyone interested in learning about bit manipulation techniques and how to implement them in C programming language
