C File I/O Project
This project demonstrates basic file I/O operations in the C programming language. It includes examples of how to use the following functions:

open: to open a file and obtain a file descriptor
close: to close a file and release the file descriptor
read: to read data from a file into a buffer
write: to write data from a buffer to a file
dprintf: to write formatted output to a file descriptor
Each example includes a brief explanation of what the function does, how to use it, and an example code snippet that demonstrates its use.

Usage
To compile the example code, run the following command:

Copy code
gcc -o file_io file_io.c
To run the example code, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
./file_io
This will run the main program, which demonstrates the use of each file I/O function.
