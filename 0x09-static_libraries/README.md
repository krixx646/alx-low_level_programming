C - Static Libraries

TASKS

0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life

Create a static library named libmy.a that includes all the listed functions below. In case you have not implemented all of the functions, create empty ones with the appropriate prototype. Remember to upload your main.h file to your repository, which should contain all the prototypes of the functions mentioned below.

1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future

Write a script named create_static_lib.sh that generates a static library named liball.a by collecting all .c files present in the current directory.
